# Fleet Management Landing Page

## Overview
This is a simple landing page UI for a fleet management platform, built using HTML and CSS. The page features a navigation bar, a headline, a description, and an image section to showcase the platform's capabilities.

## Files
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the landing page.
- **images/px.jpg**: An image file used in the image container (ensure this file exists in the `images` directory).

## Features
- **Navigation Bar**: Contains links to "Solution," "Product," and "About" pages, along with a "Get a Demo" button.
- **Headline**: Displays the main message: "Control your fleet like never before."
- **Description**: A brief two-line description of the platform's features.
- **Image Container**: Displays an image (e.g., a car logo) for visual appeal.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download**: Download the project files to your local machine.
2. **File Structure**:
   - Ensure `index.html` and `styles.css` are in the same directory.
   - Place the `px.jpg` image in an `images` folder within the project directory.
3. **Open the Page**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the landing page.
   - Ensure `styles.css` is correctly linked and the image path (`./images/px.jpg`) is valid.
4. **Customization**:
   - Modify `styles.css` to adjust colors, fonts, or layout.
   - Update `index.html` to change text, links, or the image source.

## Requirements
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- The `px.jpg` image file in the `images` directory (replace with your own image if needed).

## Notes
- The navigation links (`<a href="#">`) are placeholders. Update them with actual URLs as needed.
- Ensure the `styles.css` file exists and is correctly linked to `index.html`.
- The image (`px.jpg`) must be present in the `images` folder, or update the `src` attribute in `index.html` to point to a valid image.
